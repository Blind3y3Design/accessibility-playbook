While WCAG Level A allows organizations to cover the basics, WCAG Level AA goes further toward making web content accessible for users in a wider variety of contexts. It is for this reason that most accessibility experts recommend this conformance level. As a reminder, at this conformance level, the web page and content would satisfy all Level A and Level AA success criteria.

At Level AA, criteria includes all that is outlined at Level A plus an extra 20 requirements. Examples include:
- Text and background must use good color contrast. For example, have a minimum level of contrast of at least 4.5 to 1.
- Content should be organized under clear headings, using a logical order. For example a H1, followed by H2, H3 etc.
- Elements that affect navigation should be consistent across the site.
