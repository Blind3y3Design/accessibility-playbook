Considered the least strict, Level A success criteria are essential for every website. If your website doesn’t conform with WCAG Level A, it may have serious accessibility issues that prevent users with disabilities from using it.

At this level, within the current guidelines (WCAG 2.1) there are 30 criteria that organizations must meet. An example of the criteria includes:
- Non-text content (images and videos) must have a text equivalent.
- Users must be able to access content using a keyboard only.
- Forms must include labels or instructions, so users know what’s expected of them.
- Assistive technologies, such as screen readers, must be able to access content.
- Information or instructions must not be conveyed through shape, size or color alone.
